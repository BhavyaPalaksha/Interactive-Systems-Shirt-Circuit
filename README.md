# Interactive-Systems-Shirt-Circuit

A soft breadboard(internally connected board to prototype circuits) on textile created using handcrafted physical components which are crafted from simple off-the-shelf products like felt, copper tape, snap fits, and conductive thread. The idea is to build a breadboard on shirt with small variations to have 3 buttons and 3 LEDs, LEDs connected to one button each. On pressing the buttons, the respective LED glows. This is targeted at bicycle riders and the application is to indicate a left turn, right turn and stop.

## Getting started

Hardware requirements: 
Felt,
Conductive thread,
Sew-on female snap-fits (conductive) ,
Male snaps(conductive),
Copper tape,
LEDs,
Electrical wire,
Coin cell battery holder and coin cell batteries.

## Running the tests
Circuit tests for each level of prototype are done. All the test videos are available in 'test' folder.

## Implementation
Soft breadboard is made and all the components of circuit are built as soft components. Details available in the resources. No microcontroller used, no code involved.
